Lily Ashton (Researcher and development exec)

Lily joined LTLF in 2016 after graduating from University of Manchester with a degree in English and Drama. While in Manchester, Lily produced a play called <a href="https://youtu.be/Row299m5_T8">Novel Experiments in Living</a>, which made its debut in Manchester and then went on to wow audiences and critics alike at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. Written and directed by Rob Paterson, and starring Calum Pearce, <a href="http://mancunion.com/2016/08/04/fringe-preview-novel-experiments-living/">Novel Experiments in Living</a> has been described as a play "for a generation who feel defined by the culture they consume", while Dr. David Butler, Senior Lecturer at the Martin Harris Centre for Music and Drama states that, "Novel Experiments... skilfully contrasts mature and sincere reflections upon being a young adult in the early 21st century with glorious silliness." Lily continues to unearth great stories and talent with her continued love of stand-up and the theatre generally. She is expanding a slate nurturing her relationships, with as of yet undiscovered exciting new voices.
