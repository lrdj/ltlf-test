<p>Very exciting to be going to Venice today to see <a href="http://www.rachelmaclean.com/">Rachel Maclean</a>'s Scotland + Venice show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k7PAcKEMLg">Spite Your Face</a> which looks like it's going to be amazing!!! Of course everything Rachel does just IS amazing - and extraordinary to see how it will work in that beautiful old church.</p>

<p>I haven't been to Venice since I was 11, so I'm also very much looking forward to strolling around the canals and seeing some of the art exhibitions that are on there during this year's Venice Biennale - we'll see Damian Hirst's comeback <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/mar/26/damien-hirst-treasures-wreck-of-the-unbelievable-venice-biennale">Treasures from the wreck of the Unbelieavable</a>, and maybe there will be time to drop in and see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerith_Wyn_Evans">Cerith Wyn Evans</a> at <a href="http://www.lorcanoneill.com/site/dettaglioEsibizioneArtista.php?idEsibizione=29&amp;idArtista=18">Lorcan's Gallery</a> and <a href="http://www.nancyfouts.com/">Nancy Foutts</a> exhibition as part of Gavin Turk's <span class="caps">COLLECTION </span>- all in Venice Biennale...</p>
