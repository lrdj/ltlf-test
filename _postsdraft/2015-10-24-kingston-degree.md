<p>And there it was - the end of 4 years <a href="http://www.kingston.ac.uk/undergraduate-course/illustration-animation/">illustration and animation</a> degree at <a href="http://www.kingston.ac.uk/">Kingston University</a>. An absolutely frenetic few months getting everything finished on time - and ultimately not everything as some of the items planned for the exhibition never quite made it on time! The end of an era and the beginning of a new life.</p>

<p>There was a great turn out both in terms of the students and all their work - but also in terms of friends, family &amp; industry coming to see what they had all done. Some really interesting animated films to watch as well, lovely to see <a href="http://www.chrisshepherdfilms.com/">Chris Shepherd</a> there, animation director &amp; Kingston tutor. </p>

<p>I loved watching Anna read Playa Playa and relive those moments in Portugal. So great Apoa's put it all into a most beautiful graphic novel. She's so talented it makes me super proud of her!!</p>
