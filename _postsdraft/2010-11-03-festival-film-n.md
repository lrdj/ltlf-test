<p>This summer the Fresh Film Festival in Prague put on a retrospective of Daniel's films, you can read more about it <a href="http://en.freshfilmfest.net/a1288-a-retrospective-of-7fff-jury-members-daniel-mulloy-christoffer-boe">here</a>.  I made two little appearances this autumn, one to Camden School For Girls sixth form assembly, where I showed <span class="caps">BABY </span>to 450 sixth formers. That was a most amazing experience, so different from any industry screening - it was great! <a href="http://twitter.com/KALUUYA">Daniel Kaluuya</a> was meant to present the film, but he was busy shooting the sequel to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1634122/">Johnny English</a>, so they had to make do with me instead. I was also invited as guest filmmaker to show <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/films/">Son</a> at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/shortcutzlondon">ShortCutz</a> at the Proud Gallery in Camden. you see me <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohna/5099835399/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We have now started sending Baby out to festivals and already it has been selected at the <a href="http://www.corkfilmfest.org/pages/international-short-films">Corona Cork International Film Festival</a> and will be playing there as part of their shorts selection. The festival looks amazing with a great programme of films and a slow food evening too. <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/films/">Dad</a> will be showing at <a href="http://www.filmcourt.fr/">Brest</a>  next week, as they are putting together a special celebration of UK Films this year - again with a fantastic looking programme of shorts to see. </p>

<p>And the latest good news for <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/films/">Baby</a> is that we got nominated for a <span class="caps">BIFA </span>award!!! You can read all about it &amp; see the glamorous photos on the <a href="http://bifa.org.uk/gallery/2010-nominations"><span class="caps">BIFA</span></a> website....</p>
