After a glorious day yesterday, today the rain has begun, and it's our car rigs day!! But rather than let it dampen our spirits, we kept going. We were now filming around the streets of Tottenham, which meant setting up a unit base at the bottom of a small road. We used this as a point to rig and derig the car. It was a bit of a last minute thing, when the base Fran√ßoise (our line producer) had found for us was no longer available. Essentially a parking area within an estate, and we had to go there to rig the car at 6am on a Saturday. No matter how quiet we tried to be, I am sure the splitter van's rolling engine (our only source of power!!) and the necessary chatter just get our work done must have disturbed the residents. But not only did no one complain, I discovered warm and welcoming residents, who helped us with hot water and welcomed us into their homes to use their toilets and they wouldn't accept any money in return as thanks. One of the ladies said "It's fine. People should help each other when it is needed".

When the camera was rigged safely and rolling, Harriet was off driving around the a little ring road and we got some really great shots! Ohna and Maya put together a little video of footage - see <a href="https://youtu.be/xxhRWLJR9yc"><span class="caps">LINK</span></a>.

By the afternoon it was sunny again which meant that Cele (our costume and props lady) spent the rest of the day spritzing the car window with water to make sure we kept continuity.

The last location of the day was the car park of a small church near White Hart Lane.

The police turned up at one point (6 or 7 of them!) - when it was getting dark at 4:30pm. Ohna - The producer on set - immediately jumped, and went looking for the print outs of the location agreements but they just wanted to watch! They were very friendly, and not a lot of film shooting happens around there, and they wanted us to look out for our equipment, make sure we didn't get into trouble.
