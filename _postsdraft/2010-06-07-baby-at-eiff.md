<p>Only a week and a few days to go before Edinburgh starts.... It's the final sprint to get the film finished and the print run off in time for its cinema extreme screening on the 18th of June. The most beautiful end music has been composed, performed and recorded by Alexander Balanescu. The dolby mix was finished over at Twickenham on Friday, so now the final bits and pieces to see to at Technicolor. It is mind boggling when I think how long ago this project was thought up, then pitched, green lit, shot and now soon to be delivered.<br />
