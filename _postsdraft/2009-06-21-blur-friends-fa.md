<p>Claire got us tickets to the Blur gig yesterday afternoon at the Brixton Academy which was great fun. It was really good watching &amp; hearing them play together again. It was strange thinking that the last time I saw them live was when Apoa (or was it Kiloh?) was in my belly &amp; due in about 2 weeks. It was a pretty full on gig at Ally Pally but I can't remember now who all else was playing there, but I remember thinking it was one of the more uncomfortable things I did in pregnancy (oh yeah &amp; that 10 hour bike ride up &amp; down hills in Devon at 8 months). Anyway, there I was with Kiloh &amp; Apoa (now all beautiful and grown up) standing in front of me, when suddenly Kiloh started forwards and crashed flat on the floor without even putting her hands out to protect herself. What a shock! I went after her and tried to drag her up off the floor but she was completely dead weight and absolutely motionless. I thought had somebody pushed her? Had she been shot? When suddenly after about two seconds she came to, looked up at me and said "I fainted!". She almost immediately jumped back up on her feet and then said "how cool!". Yikes! Anyway, she was fine after that but that was certainly a moment I'll remember!</p>
