We have spent the last few weeks searching for music for the short film and of course MySpace is an invaluable tool when it comes to music.

To search MySpace for interesting new talent you have to create you own MySpace account though, so I sat down with Apoa and Kiloh and they showed me how it works. They helped me choose backgrounds, create photo albums, pick a song etc... and build a MySpace page.

It turned out to be lots of fun but I am hoping I don't get hooked. Alcohol, drugs, myspace..... Then again it's another device that sets your life out there into the public domain, or whatever aspect of your life you choose to put out there. I guess everyone's got different things they're hoping to gain from it - for directors and musicians looking to get their work out there, single people trying to hook up or teenagers finding new fun ways to delve into the world and make their mark.
