<p>As we approach our final <a href="http://crosschannelfilmlab.com/"><span class="caps">CCFL</span></a> workshop and gear up to be ready for the <a href="http://crosschannelfilmlab.com/tag/stereo-3d/">presentations in Falmouth</a>, it's good to catch up with all the key members of the <span class="caps">CCFL </span>team on skype. The script work has been progressing really well and we're excited to have <a href="http://www.christopher-andrews.com/">Chris Andrews</a> back on board to get to the next draft. Here's a little snap of <a href="http://crosschannelfilmlab.com/antoine-le-bos/">Antoine Le Bos</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/35136451">François Garnier</a> and <a href="http://www.beyond-festival.com/en/symposium/speaker/josephine-derobe">Joséphine Derobe</a> who have been working with us.</p>

<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/11/CCFL_SkypeCall2-1087.html" onclick="window.open('{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/11/CCFL_SkypeCall2-1087.html','popup','width=1217,height=697,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/11/CCFL_SkypeCall2-thumb-500x286-1087.png" width="500" height="286" alt="CCFL_SkypeCall2.png" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>Now I look forward to starting my <a href="http://www.closing-the-gap.net/">Closing The Gap</a> training. I'm excited not only to have been accepted onto the programme but have had <a href="http://creativeskillset.org/who_we_help/creative_professionals">Creative Skillset</a> 's support to help cover the costs. It's an investment training programme that leads up to equity investor pitching in Berlin in December.</p>
