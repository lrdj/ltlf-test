<p>I got back from Nottingham last night where I spent two days involved in the cinema extreme workshop despite Daniel not being able to make it as he is still in Cuba in the middle of the Una Noche shoot. I really enjoyed it, and again it is always a pleasure meeting the other filmmakers and hearing about their projects and of course it is very stimulating hearing what they think about yours too. We worked on two of Daniel's script options and I've left a little unsure which one to move forward, but I can't wait for Daniel to get back so we get working on all the fresh ideas that came through. Of course they still need to knock back 26 projects to be left with only 4. That's probably harsher competition than getting into a nice school...</p>
