<p>With half our house under siege with subsidence work, we were happy to see the new year in out in Melbourne Australia this year - which in effect meant we celebrated it a good 11 hours before everyone in the <span class="caps">UK.</span> Turns out Australia is a great place for New Year and fireworks and Christmas day on the beach...</p>

<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-17%20at%2021.34.25.png"><img alt="New Years Eve in Melbourne" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2017/01/Screen Shot 2017-01-17 at 21.34.25-thumb-500x367-1442.png" width="500" height="367" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>This week Teresa May paves the way for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/17/theresa-may-brexit-speech-pound-steadies-ahead-of-theresa-mays-brexit-speech-politics-live">pulling out of the EU</a>, Obama steps down as US president and Trump takes his place in the White House in a couple of days - his official inauguration on 20th of Jan... Again it's Michelle who makes the most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc5Zvd8AaQI">moving speech</a>.</p>

<p>So goodness knows what lies ahead this year! I liked the Scottish Sunday Herald's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/billybraggofficial/photos/a.249499147470.158205.44905697470/10154007022862471/?type=3&amp;theater">TV guide entry</a> (as posted by Billy Bragg) - something that seems straight out of a bad soap for sure! How all of this will impact on the 2017 zetgeist, policy, and generally people's everyday lives? </p>

<p>Well in good old producing tradition, we plough on regardless and make the most of whatever the situation will be - but with even more <span class="caps">URGENCY.</span> And so we prepare for <a href="http://www.emergence-cinema.fr/">Ã‰mergence</a>, a fantastic new opportunity that has come our way for the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/films-in-development.html">Girl from the Estuary</a>. We will be prepping two or three scenes from the film (casting, recceing and shooting) under the tutelage of industry experts in Paris - cool.</p>

<p>The lineup for this winter will be to attach French distribution and World sales to raise the rest of the finance for The Girl from the Estuary, whilst progressing the development work on the rest of the slate. I am very much looking forward to meeting my <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/guiding-lights/mentors-and-mentees/2016-2017-mentees-mentors">Guiding Lights</a> mentor very soon who, if all goes well, will guide me towards successful outcomes. We spent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BPImRyGAo-DB5JV59f_mvkzwyPMNEYAK7HXn980/?taken-by=ruthpaxton">a fantastic <span class="caps">GL8 </span>day</a> with script consultant and industry stalwart <a href="http://www.kateleys.co.uk/">Kate Leys</a>, who gave us her insights, helped us encapsulate our projects into one sentences, and encouraged us to pitch our projects to each other - and then receive the feedback silently (absolutely NO speaking and no answering questions), attentively and most importantly with marked gratitude (a slice of cake, a bacon sandwich...). Very wise and useful advice to start the year with. </p>

<p>I will be part of the international jury at <a href="http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/?nlang=2">Clermont Ferrand</a> this year, so I am looking forward to discovering a lot of new talent - although quite daunting prospect as there will be 75 short films to watch!!! And then it will be straight on to Berlin from there for the <a href="https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/sektionen_sonderveranstaltungen/wettbewerb/index.html">67th Berlinale</a>.</p>
