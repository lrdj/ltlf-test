Today Tom and I finished our first commercial for Rattling Stick. It's a spot for Kelloggs with Ray Winstone that we shot for JWT London. The shoot was a great success and I hope the post will be too! The agency team were lovely Dave Shelton and Liz Whiston were the creatives and Katie Keith the producer. Ian Murray did a fantastic job lighting it and was a pleasure to work with, as were the whole crew. I am looking forward to the next one. 

Rattling Stick is a really exciting company to be working with, it is a pleasure to be here!
