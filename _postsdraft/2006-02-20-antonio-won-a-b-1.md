How exciting <a href="http://www.antoniosbreakfast.com/ab1_content.html">Antonio's Breakfast</a> won the BAFTA after all!!! All I saw on the TV was a 2 second glimpse of Amber on stage clutching the mask. Where was Daniel? Surely he was there? Either way it is great news and I am sure we will benefit from it no end.

Tomorrow I am off to Sydney to shoot a few FOSTERS commercials with Director <a href="http://www.hsilondon.co.uk/Director.aspx?id=48">PAUL MIDDLEDITCH</a>. 21 hours in the air is sounding very appealing to me just now. Catch up on a few movies. Catch up on some sleep. No phone calls...

And back on the 9th of March, missing my precious <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohna/sets/72057594075752125/">Apoa's 13th birthday</a> and my no less precious Kiloh's secondary school acceptance letters. The suspense is terrible...
