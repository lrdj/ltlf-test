<p>Last night was the final Grouchos party celebrating its 25 years. After that was karaoke night, ending with the karaoke staple Total Eclipse of the Heart - everyone singing their little hearts out (including Tracy Emin). A full night at Grouchos means leaving trusty bicycle behind - of course. I always worry when I do that because the little hooks outside Grouchos mean your bike is barely locked up at all. But on my way in this morning I was greeted by two policemen &amp; lots of blue &amp; white tape surrounding it! What happened there? I thought maybe it was a bit of overkill, but gratefully all the same, I retrieved it &amp; cycled off to work.<br />
