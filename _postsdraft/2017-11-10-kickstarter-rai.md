<a href="https://youtu.be/DQmD63uyKCE">Here</a> is a BTS video to watch made for us by the talented Maya McAllister Demangeat!

We are very very grateful to our generous backers who are making this all possible. I can't wait to start editing! The rushes look amazing. Kyla did an amazing job and Harriet and Isabella gave us such great performances, they really brought the whole thing to life and I look forward to working with them on the feature. It'll be awesome.
