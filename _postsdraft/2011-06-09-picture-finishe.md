It is looking amazing (see the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10150341366545689&amp;set=vb.173346549380509&amp;type=2&amp;theater">trailer</a>) and I can't wait to start sending it off to festivals. The tracklay is done and now all we need to do is the final mix. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Doug&amp;Peter225.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/Doug%26Peter225.jpg" width="225" height="113" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></span></p>
