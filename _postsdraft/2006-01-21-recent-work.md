<p>Having produced commercials and promos for many years and after working as Head of Commercials Production at Exposure Films (now known as <a href="http://www.hsilondon.co.uk/"><span class="caps">HSI</span> London</a>) from January 2005 to January 2006 , I have more recently decided to try to link my strengths within that industry with my enthusiasm for the longer format. </p>

<p>I have been collaborating with Director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1142205/">Daniel Mulloy</a> on his film projects whilst completing final post on his latest short film <em><span class="caps">DAD</span></em> which is scheduled to premiere at Edinburgh this summer 06 as part of the UK Film Council / Maya completion fund. I have also produced a short film called <em><span class="caps">SISTER</span></em> with Daniel which was funded by the Arts Council of Wales and opened the Cardiff Film Festival in November 2004. It won a Welsh <span class="caps">BAFTA </span>for best short and the Arte Prize at <span class="caps">HAMBURG</span> 2005. It is coming to the end of its festival circuit and has won many other awards including best cinematography at Bucharest. </p>

<p>Through Exposure Films, I have been co-producing <em><span class="caps">THE POND</span></em>, a short film written and directed by Sonja Phillips. We still need to shoot a day of underwater photography to complete the project, but funds are now in place for this, so we hope to finish the film by the end of summer. I have also been working as post production supervisor on Barney Clay's short film <em><span class="caps">FINKLE'S ODYSSEY</span></em> which is also very near to completion now, after over a year's worth of fantastic and surprising <span class="caps">VFX </span>work.</p>

<p>I am now based at <a href="http://www.rattlingstick.com/">Rattling Stick</a> (award winning Directors Danny Kleinman and Ringan Ledwidge's new company) producing commercials for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0891114/">Tom Vaughan</a> who recently joined from his previous company <span class="caps">HLA </span>after completing his first feature film <em><span class="caps">STARTER FOR TEN</span></em> with James McAvoy. Here I am also able to look after my independent film projects whilst promoting and producing for Tom..... </p>

<p>We shoot our first commercial next week (last week of August - barely a month after joining) with <span class="caps">JWT </span>&amp; starring Ray Winstone. Should be fun!</p>
