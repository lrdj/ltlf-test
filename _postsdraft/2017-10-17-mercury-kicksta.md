<p>So we launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mercuryshortfilm/mercury-a-short-film?ref=6v8168">Kickstarter</a> campaign yesterday for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mercuryshortfilm/">Mercury</a> and hopefully we will raise £7,500 by November 16 2017 11:10am (not sure if that's <span class="caps">GMT </span>or <span class="caps">USA </span>time). </p>

<p>I know it's a lot of work getting people to back projects like these when there are so many similar crowd funding campaigns on the go and so many raising money for helpless desperate causes as well as these artistic endeavours.  In any case we will keep the Mercury <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mercuryshortfilm/">instagram</a> feed alive with fun content, keep pushing and hope for the best! I'm really enjoying that it's making me get in touch with everyone meaningfully - as it's a big deal asking people for money.</p>

<p>So far by the end of Day 1 we had reached just under 19% of our target so I think that's really good.</p>

<p>On a prep front we have finished workshopping with our actresses now. We've started working out costume and props, we're locking down locations and searching for additional cast and street locations. We fell in love with St Thomas <a href="http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/st-thomas-hospital.html">Hospital</a> as our end location, and for where Al and Bambi start off, the Broadwater Farm <a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/235530">Estate</a> in <a href="https://www.primelocation.com/to-rent/commercial/property/london/west-green-road/">Tottenham</a> (where the film is set) is amazing - so we hope to get permission there sorted and work out our street locations over the next few days.</p>

<p>Our challenge this week is to find the third hero of our film: <a href="https://d3d9npwwya966f.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/datsun_cherry_120a-coupe_73.jpg"><span class="caps">THE DREAM CAR</span></a>! </p>

<p>So more news on that when it comes in...</p>
