<p>It was good news to hear that The Pond was shortlisted for the Fujifilm shorts competition. They must have a pretty extensive mailing list as I received many nice messages of congratulations. I guess it's unlikely we'll win, but it's still nice to be shortlisted. The print has been sent off to Barcelona and California last week, so it's still making its way around the world... Fingers crossed it might win a few more prizes.</p>
