<p>We have two wins to celebrate after this year's <a href="http://www.shots.net/news/awards-festivals-events/82561/shots-awards-2013-winners-announced.html">Shots Awards 2013</a>  took place last night (Thursday 28 November). It's one of Advertising's Biggest Nights celebrating achievements in media &amp; advertising at a house packed full of creatives, directors, producers, editors...</p>

<p>First up was  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp63Qpp8h4k"><b>Room 8</b></a>  which led to wins by <a href="http://www.moving-picture.com/"><span class="caps">MPC</span> London</a> who triumphed in a very strong field Post Production House of the Year with an extremely strong body of work. And then <a href="http://www.gravityroad.com/">Gravity Road</a> and <a href="http://www.independ.net/">Independent Films</a> picked up the award for Branded Short Film of the Year for the excellent, mind-bending Bombay Sapphire film, directed by <a href="http://www.jwgriffiths.com/">James W Griffiths</a> (who has since been signed by Independent). Beyond those who picked up the award, there are lots of people to thank for the success of the film, most notably <a href="http://www.vennerfilm.com/">Sophie Venner</a> who came on board to produce it and Adrian Marler who worked with James on the concepts and how to shoot it, <a href="http://www.peterfrancisfilmdesigner.com/peterfrancisfilmdesigner.com/home.html">Peter Francis</a> who designed the sets, <a href="http://magniagustsson.com/">Magni Agustsson</a> who lit it, <a href="http://www.lennertbusch.com/">Lennert Busch</a> who composed the music, Kasia Lesniak's team out in Poland who worked on it despite the tiny budget, and of course <a href="https://twitter.com/tomcullenactor">Tom Cullen</a> and <a href="http://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/michael-gould/">Michael Gould</a> who starred in it!</p>

<p>2013's Editor of the Year was won by 2011 shots Award-winner and super talented editor of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/life2livefilmscrocodile"><b>Crocodile</b></a> Paul Hardcastle of Trim Editing who was there last night until the early hours this morning and so is feeling a bit rough today. He might not be as much fun as he might otherwise be at Trim's Christmas lunch today. </p>

<p>I am sure everyone had a great night of it. I hope Sophie hasn't lost her mobile, and I guess it's Friday today, so how ambitious does everyone need to be. Well done everyone!</p>
