<p>I forgot to add this picture to the Sardinia Maia workshop entry. Linda Beath's initiation to her group of emerging producers was the average making-a-movie-timeline, from inception to when an audience will sit in front of a screen and watch it. I might have posted it a bit too small to read here (click on it &amp; it opens bigger), but it starts in April 2015 with an idea for a film and ends in February 2022 with some money trickling back to someone (although god knows who...) once the sales people have got it out to a few places for people to go and watch it - starting in January 2020. So basically - you gotta look 7 years ahead. </p>

<p>And I guess the wisdom we took from that was "learn to pace yourself" "More urgency, less haste!". "Yes ok I'll have that glass of wine".</p>

<p>I think Linda would agree...</p>
