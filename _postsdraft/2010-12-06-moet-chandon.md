<p>Last night we celebrated as we won <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/films/trailers/baby.html">best short</a> at the <a href="http://bifa.org.uk/news/winners-announced-13th-mo%C3%ABt-british-independent-film-awards"><span class="caps">BIFA</span>s</a> &amp; Daniel and I collected our <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/news/">award</a> and a giant bottle of champagne (c/o of our sponsors) with <span class="caps">BABY </span>carefully and beautifully scripted in sparkly gems. What a thrill! We were surrounded by some of the UKs finest independent cinema talents. Helena Bonham Carter and Colin Firth were sat at the table beside us with their successful King's Speech contingent. But within this prestigious gathering, lurked a shameless individual or group of individuals who thought once the free bar closed down at 01:30am (after <span class="caps">BIFA'</span>s &amp; Moët's hugely generous 7 hours of free booze on tap) that they should help themselves to our <span class="caps">BABY </span>trophy and made away with the bottle in a flurry! I'm hoping the wonderful team at <span class="caps">BIFA </span>will find the empty bottle amongst the detritus and forward it on to me... Otherwise all I have left is this picture taken by the fabulous Helen Grace.</p>
