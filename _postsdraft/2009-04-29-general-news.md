<p>So I am now getting ready for my stint in Cannes. I'll be going from 15th to 20th May. Daniel and I have met the cinema extreme deadline, so we can forget about that til June. Next Daniel has to get his Advance Party II treatment in to Sigma Films within the next couple of weeks and we need to concentrate on the treatments for the 3 feature projects Daniel has been writing.</p>
