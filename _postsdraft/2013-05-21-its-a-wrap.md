<p>We finished our Crocodile shoot on Friday. Six very action packed days shooting around London &amp; Kent locations. I will post more news and pictures soon, but we received a lovely message from our lead actor <a href="http://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/michael-gould/">Michael Gould</a>: "I can now say that I have eaten flip flops, swum with crocodiles and I can survive extremely cold water (just) but more than that ... I am looking forward to doing it again as soon as I can."</p>
