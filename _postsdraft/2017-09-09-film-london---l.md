<p>Lily and I booked out the whole day yesterday to go watch all 21 London Calling shorts at the <span class="caps">BFI </span>- <span class="caps">NFT3.</span></p>

<p>We were well and truly impressed with the whole presentation. Some films stood out in particular including and beyond the winning films which were:</p>

<p><b>Fighter</b> written by Guy Bolton and directed by Bugsy Riverbank-Steel and the fabulous Tina Pawlik. I think that one won 2 awards - one for cinematography and the jury award for best short which it shared with the really quite excellent <b>Wren Boys</b> written by John Fitzpatrick, directed by Harry Lighton and produced by Sorcha Bacon. And finally for the best London Calling Plus award it was the excellent <b>Kara</b> written &amp; directed by Deepa Kashvala, produced by Gloria Bowman and EPed by Daniel Wolfe of Somesuch.</p>

<p>I will definitely be looking some of these people up, there were some very strong entries, really good performances and ideas - I probably won't remember all but both <b>His Wake</b> (Jamie Noel) and <b>Modern Props</b> (Ruaidhri Ryan), <b>New Year</b> (Lauren Bensted), <b>V</b> (Ellie Gocher), <b>Bitter Sea</b> (Fateme Ahmadi), <b>Fog</b> (Shan Christopher Ogilvie), <b>To Wendy Who Kicked Me When I Said I Love You</b> (Christian Sandino-Taylor and Dan Castella), <b>Landline</b> (Matt Houghton), <b>Support</b> (Troy Hunter and Christiana Ebohon-Green) and the sumptuous <b>The Field</b> (Sandhya Suri) shot in India... </p>

<p>Some of the films had big companies behind them (Pulse, Moxie, Somesuch...) and one had co-funding from the <span class="caps">CNC</span>! Others were genuine beginners.</p>

<p>Josic Cadoret and his team at Film London organised the day so there were plenty opportunities to meet everyone over lunch, teas &amp; wine... And of course a pleasure to see Nicolas Chaudeurge there with Sandhi (he edited The Field), and meet her French producer Balthazar de Ganay. </p>
