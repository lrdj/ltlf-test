<p>I was bit trepidatious about <a href="http://nexusproductions.com/commercials">Nexus</a> moving to Old Street and into an even bigger building than before and Gaëlle having to share a new office with other animation directors. Mainly because our wall of La Fille De <span class="caps">L'E</span>stuaire has been the back-drop for so much of our work!! I was sad to say good bye. </p>

<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2015/10/Nexus office move-1252.html" onclick="window.open('{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2015/10/Nexus office move-1252.html','popup','width=999,height=617,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2015/10/Nexus office move-thumb-500x308-1252.png" width="500" height="308" alt="Nexus office move.png" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>Along with changing offices we have changed co-writers! Now we are working with <a href="http://www.casarotto.co.uk/client/amber-trentham-11555">Amber Trentham.</a></p>
