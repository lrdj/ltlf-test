<p>I forgot to mention that I did indeed go to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UnaNocheFilm">Una Noche</a> screening at The Barbican last week. It was a very moving experience going to see the film and listening to Lucy's <span class="caps">Q&amp;A </span>afterwards. It brought back the whole experience of the prep and the trip to Cuba, that intense energy that is so singular to the Mulloys. I was surprised to re-discover my little cameo in the film! I was a 'tourist' walking down the street, as 'policeman' Daniel beats up 'unsuspecting man' in a back alleyway. I remember us getting in trouble from the real police when they saw Daniel in his uniform which wasn't a perfect fit (trousers way too short etc). They were not happy if Lucy was going to make the police look ridiculous in her film!</p>

<p>The film is beautiful and touching. Lucy drew out amazing performances from her three leads. As I watched Lila it's hard not think of her as a young Lucy. It's probably true to say that many personal elements in the film are what make so much of the film ring true.</p>

<p>It was also emotional seeing Lucy's proud parents and talking to Lucy &amp; Daniel's mum (talented filmmaker <a href="http://www.veraneubauer.com/">Vera Neubauer</a>). I hope they will all have a similar event to celebrate with Daniel's first feature too sometime soon.</p>
