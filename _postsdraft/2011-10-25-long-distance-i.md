Last night was the London Calling screening in <span class="caps">NFT1 </span>and the last as part of the London Film Festival. Both short film programmes were really good and last night I particularly enjoyed <a href="http://www.katesullivan.co.uk/page21.htm">Walk Tall</a> by animator <a href="http://www.katesullivan.co.uk/page3.htm">Kate Sullivan</a>. It was a really fresh little film with beautiful illustrations and a most charismatic ex Olympic <span class="caps">OAP, </span>a really lovely film. Our film was also really well received and it was great to be immersed in the positive crowd reactions.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/lff/node/1790">The School Of Life</a> screenings were equally enjoyable <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Doug, Simon &amp; Terry" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/Doug_Simon_Terry225.jpg" width="225" height="169" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span> and Douglas got to meet Terry Gilliam who also had a short in the programme. There was also a beautiful little film in the group called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2072063/">Bird</a> by Jane Shearer &amp; Steve Ayson of <a href="http://www.nzff.co.nz/kerikeri/film/95360b24-e3e4-419d-a7b6-2a454ef7ccf3">New Zealand</a>. I hope it does well on the festival circuit &amp; I look forward to catching all the shorts I missed at <span class="caps">LFF </span>at <a href="http://www.encounters-festival.org.uk/">Encounters</a> next month. </p>
