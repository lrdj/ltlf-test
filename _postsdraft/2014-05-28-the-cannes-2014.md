<p>I just wanted to say what a good experience Gaëlle and I had in Cannes and seeing our film fund <a href="http://www.bfi.org.uk/supporting-uk-film/funding-filmmakers/about-film-fund-team"><span class="caps">BFI </span>peeps</a> there. Firstly it was such a lovely surprise to see Chris Collins at the Film4 party. It was also really nice getting a chance to hang out with David Segal Hamilton in a relaxed context. He was our <span class="caps">BFI </span>exec along with Natascha Wharton and Emily at Lighthouse. And finally how great is Ben Roberts?! Ultimately Gaëlle and I found the whole Crocodile experience a steep but satisfying challenge. We are really happy with the results and feel we have a lot to be thankful for. I hope we can organise a cast &amp; crew screening of Crocodile in London soon and I look forward to seeing everyone again when that happens.</p>
