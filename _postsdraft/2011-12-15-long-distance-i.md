<p>I've been so busy it's hard to keep the news up to date, especially as far as <span class="caps">LDI </span>goes. People are calling out for it from all over the world now. We have had the immense pleasure of being invited to screen at <a href="http://www.sundance.org/press-center/release/2012-festival-program-announcement-shorts/">Sundance</a> and now immediately following on from that at <a href="http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/index.php?lang=1&amp;m=213&amp;c=4&amp;o=&amp;id_pers=100367684&amp;id_soc=&amp;o=88">Clermont Ferrand</a>. There will be a special screening of <span class="caps">LDI </span>at <a href="http://www.glasgowfilm.org/festival">Glasgow Film Festival</a>, where the film is probably most at home - being home to both director (Douglas Hart) and lead actor (Peter Mullan) and I believe the rest of the cast too (Caroline Paterson &amp; Alan Tripney). They will have a special retrospective screening of <a href="http://www.hsilondon.co.uk/cat/music-videos/director/douglas-hart/charlatans---love-is-ending-262">Doug's</a> pop promos over the years as well as the film itself.</p>

<p>For the Christmas launch of his sold out vinyl Christmas single <a href="http://www.new-album.com/2011/12/gruff-rhys-atheist-xmas-2011/">Atheist Christmas</a>, written for <span class="caps">LDI, </span><a href="http://www.gruffrhys.com/">Gruff Rhys</a> will be doing a special gig at <a href="http://www.roughtrade.com/site/instore.lasso">Rough Trade</a> shops in London on the 19th of December. Don't miss it!</p>

<p>At some point I'll have to update the festival circuit list as it is quickly growing with many more about to come... But first off in the new year will be <a href="http://shortfilms.org.uk/">The London Short Film Festival</a> and Doug is schedule to participate in a <span class="caps">Q&amp;A </span>on the 13th of January. More details to follow.</p>
