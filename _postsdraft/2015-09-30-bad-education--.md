<p>I had a fun little interlude before Cannes working on the pick up shots for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSLFUsHAXTs">Bad Education - The Movie</a>. Which involved finding locations in Amsterdam and shooting <a href="http://www.jackwhitehall.com/">Jack Whitehall</a> cycling with a stolen Anne Frank ET revival doll and swooping up a ramp and falling into the canal. Fun!</p>

<p>I stepped in for my producer friend <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1310698/">Sarada</a> and it was great working at <a href="http://www.tigeraspect.co.uk/">Tiger Aspect</a> again - first time for years and years. It was pretty intense getting it all together and I was really grateful for the most amazing <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1243948/">Rachel Alabaster</a> who stepped in to help even though she was meant to be leaving, and Agustina Gonz√°lez who also stepped in at short notice to help out. It was really lovely teaming up with Joe Carter again (as 1st AD) who I hadn't seen for ages, and working in Amsterdam, what an amazing place. And lovely to meet director producer team Elliott Hegarty and Pippa Brown.</p>
