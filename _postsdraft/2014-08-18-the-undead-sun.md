<p>We finished shooting the Undead Sun on Friday a new film by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_and_Louise_Wilson">Jane and Louise Wilson</a> which I produced through <a href="http://www.fvu.co.uk/">Film and Video Umbrella</a>. It's a film commissioned by the <a href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/iwm-london">Imperial War Museum</a> and will form part of their <span class="caps">WWI </span>centenary commemorations exhibitions.  </p>

<p>Great to have the old Toxic Camera team back together again <a href="http://www.martintestar.com/">Teddy Testar</a>, Daniel Brough and <a href="http://www.deansteadman.com/">Dean Steadman</a> on camera, <a href="http://yroxmusic.com/">Daniel Goddard</a> editing, Dave Morgan on 10&#215;8s... And lovely to discover <a href="http://www.nicholasmortimer.net/">Nicholas Mortimer</a> on production design and model making, Chloe Gross on costumes and Martin Kloud on lights, Joshua Dadson as camera assistant and <span class="caps">DIT </span>and genius with the zoom recorder too. We had a great cast too thanks to fabulous fvu production assistant <a href="http://www.alixtaylor.com/">Alix Taylor</a> who found them (Scott Wickes and David Wayman), as well as helping on the production side while at the same time planning and organising her wedding and a <a href="http://www.greenhornfestival.com/">film festival</a> in November!</p>
