<p>More good news... While we were enjoying a luxurious holiday out in Bergerac last week, I got two pieces of exciting news! First good news was that Daniel and I were awarded the <span class="caps">UKFC </span>&amp; Film4's cinema extreme this year &amp; hope to be shooting Daniel's next short film <span class="caps">BABY </span>in early autumn this year. The second bit of good news is that I qualified for the European Producer's forum at the Open Russian Film Festival in Sochi - which means I am flying out to Russia on Monday! Emily at the UK Film Council suggested I apply with our Murmansk project as within the forum they will introduce us to Russian financiers and film industry and explain procedures and how to apply for local funding etc.... The one caveat seems to be that I get my visa sorted this afternoon which has proven to be trickier than you'd think (seeing as I've been invited by the Russian Foreign Ministry &amp; all). But of course 'easy' is a dirty word in the world of production, so I am unphased and excited regardless. </p>
