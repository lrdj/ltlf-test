<p>And here's another couple of pics from the Pet Shop Boys promo we shot last week.  <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Claire_Popstar300.jpg" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/Claire_Popstar300.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></span> <br />
One of Claire as pop star.</p>

<p>Neil posed with Douglas for his twitter page. I guess I'll have to get the iphone before I quite manage to upload anything interesting like pictures onto Twitter properly. The song was called Did You See Me Coming. It did sound terribly familiar, but as Neil joked, they've been doing the same thing for years and years, so no surprises there.<br />
