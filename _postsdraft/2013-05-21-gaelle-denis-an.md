<p>We wrapped on Friday night, spent Saturday returning props, mini-buses and reinstating locations and on Sunday morning first thing we hopped on a plane and here we are in Cannes!</p>

<p>Tired but enjoying the sunshine and the sea. Lots of meetings with <a href="http://www.lavoielacteeproductions.com/lavoielactee3/Home.html">Nathalie Algazi</a> and <a href="http://www.torinofilmlab.it/person.php?id=678">Jakob Beckman</a> on Gaëlle's Torino AdaptLab feature project. </p>

<p>First person we bumped into was the fabulous <a href="http://www.doublex.co.uk/drama2006.htm">Robbie Ryan</a> who is here with his dad with a feature he lit called Last Day On Mars. Also bumped into Mark Kozlowski who was working with us on Crocodile - Best <span class="caps">DIT </span>in town, looking far more relaxed in Cannes doing meetings to make his own film!</p>

<p>Get in touch if you are here we'd love to join you for a glass of rosé!</p>

<p>So far we have managed to see 2 films, <a href="http://www.semainedelacritique.com/EN//films/2013/2013_comp_For_those_in_Peril.php">For Those In Peril</a> by Paul Wright and Baz Luhrmann's <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/wb/thegreatgatsby/">Great Gatsby</a> (but we watched it in French!!). We also managed a red carpet evening courtesy of Nathalie and Marie who got us tickets for <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/may/22/cannes-only-good-forgives-ryan-gosling-review">Only God Forgives</a>, Nicholas Winding Refn's new film with Ryan Gosling &amp; Kristin Scott Thomas. Very stylish and beautiful but pretty boring really, shame.</p>
