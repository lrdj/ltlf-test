Summer feels like it was only a couple of weeks ago (the weather does have something to answer for on that one) and instead of lazing about the pool I was prepping a little Cadburys commercial. Then came the Tottenham riots revisted and we were watching London up in flames on our little Lacanau TV set. We had to move the shoot when it became dangerous scouting the city at night and one of our location finders was mugged by 8 youths with baseball bats! Thankfully he wasn't hurt. Anyway fast forward to Friday and we were finally delivering the finished job. Anyway here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJfcJKFXsTA">link</a>. And actually here it is in the context of the <a href="http://www.keepourteampumped.com/videos/category/song1/">keepteamgbpumped.com</a> campaign</p>

<p>The commercial was shot through Independent and the directors were called <a href="http://hrepresentstheblog.com/category/directors/jonnie-ross/">Jonnie</a> and <a href="http://www.rabbitcontent.com/us/">Trevor</a>. What a lovely pair of directors to work with! Trevor had to rush home to be with his pregnant wife who in fact gave birth to a little baby boy on the 27th of September - so we were all glad he didn't stick around! </p>

<p>They came to London at the beginning of August and were surprised by our eclectic weather. It very soon became a matter of urgency to get them to the shops to stock up on appropriate London weather gear after which everything ran smoothly. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Jonnie &amp; Trevor" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/Jonnie%26Trevor225.jpg" width="225" height="301" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /></span></p>

<p>You have to watch Jonnie's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQJUAFOpK2Y">humping movie</a> for <span class="caps">MTV </span>called "My Humps". Not sure if it was on the back of that he was approached to do a Cadburys commercial. Maybe <a href="http://hrepresentstheblog.com/2011/09/17/trevor-mcmahan-people-for-bikes-projection-art/">this lovely film</a> of Trevor's helped too?</p>

<p>All night prep and night shooting again, which does of course solve problems like traffic and parking, but doesn't half make loos an unwelcome preoccupation.</p>
