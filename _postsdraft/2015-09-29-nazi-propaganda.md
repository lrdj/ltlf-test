<p><span class="caps">MAIS NON</span>! no no it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJpQnKTLXCs&amp;feature=em-share_video_user">Jed's book</a>!! Finally after 10 years writing and drawing, grandad Jed has published a graphic novel. It's already got <a href="http://www.woolamaloo.org.uk/?tag=jed-falby">rave reviews</a> and he's been <a href="http://www.budlitfest.org.uk/jed-falby-paul-gravett-budleigh-salterton-literary-festival-devon/">doing talks</a> with <a href="http://www.paulgravett.com/?chocaid=397">Paul Gravett</a> of Comicon at the Budleigh literary festival. It's available to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Le-Train-De-Michel-Story/dp/0857100947">buy at amazon</a>. How fantastic and now he's already working on the next one. Let's hope the next one doesn't take another 10 years!</p>

<p>Out of a clear blue sky the telephone rang:<br />
"Hi Jed, This is Paddy Ashdown . . . "<br />
He called me just to tell me how much he<br />
admired the book and could well imagine<br />
the work that went into it.<br />
If he could do anything to help - just let him know.<br />
I was so struck by his call out of the blue that I forgot<br />
to ask him for his phone number!<br />
I had met him at last years Lit. Fest. where he was<br />
promoting his book "A Cruel Victory" also about<br />
the French Resistance. I didn't expect him to remember<br />
that with the many people he must meet all over.</p>
