I have been producing TV commercials since the 90s through many different production companies. Here are a few examples of ads I produced through [Dirty](http://www.dirtyfilms.uk/), [Independent](http://www.independ.net/about-us/), [HSI London](http://www.hsilondon.co.uk/), [BBH](http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/) and [Rattling Stick](http://www.rattlingstick.com/). Some are for TV and some for online usage.  

Most recent is an [LV= commercial](http://www.designate.com/2016/07/04/designate-make-better-lv/) for Designate in Brighton.
