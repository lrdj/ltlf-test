<p>My first film Cannes was really great. The weather was hot pretty much all the time, the flat we were staying in had a pool (though it was out of order - hors d'usage or whetever the sign said) and it was near enough the city centre that we could walk everywhere. 6 of us shared the 3 bedrooms &amp; living room sofabed and the sharing worked really well. I would definitely hope to get something similar next year. Well done Dawn Sharpless!</p>

<p>Our first night we all went out to dinner at a lovely seafood restaurant and sat next to Francis Ford Coppola.</p>

<p>I am sad that I hardly took any pictures. Particularly at the Nowhere Boy party, which must have been the party highlight of the week, with dancing all night and celebs to keep the paps busy flashing all night (Paris, Peaches, Ryan Phillippe etc...). In fact Kirstin Scott Thomas danced all night too. When the party was over, we thanked the DJ and he told us to follow him to his next gig. So we did, avoiding the sea of paparazzis that swallowed poor Paris up in the middle of the Croisette, and followed him through the narrow streets and into the next venue.</p>

<p>The club was great, but when the show changed over and men dressed as lampshades started filling the stage and the music changed we got a bit suspicious. Sure enough a foxy lady sat on stage knitting while a man cat pulled at her yarn until her jumper unravelled and two red heart-shaped nipple coverettes were all that was left. We thought maybe it was time to wander home!</p>

<p>Overall the festival was a busy time and a great opportunity to meet non-London based people you don't get to see often, Russian &amp; Australian producers, people from the UK Film Council in short sleeves and pretty dresses, people you forgot you knew and obviously a lot of interesting people you would never otherwise get to meet. </p>

<p>Of course a lot of rose wine was consummed and in fact one of my more pleasurable afternoons was spent drinking too many bottles to mention in the lovely presence of Sarada McDermott from Liverpool and Rob How from London.</p>

<p>Al Morrow was invited to a Slumdog Millionaire party by a crazy man who lived in a millionaire's mansion. Of course we never went.</p>

<p>Helen Grace was busy with her horror film Colin which was made for Â£45 and became a great Cannes success story saleswise. Although I haven't heard the whole story yet, so I hope it remains a great success story.</p>

<p>Of course there's much more, but it's probably unwise to go on as it makes it sound like it was all too much fun.</p>
