<p>I was so excited to hear that <a href="http://gaelledenis.com/">Gaëlle</a> has got through to the first round of the <a href="http://www.filmlab.jsfs.co.il/">Jerusalem Film Lab</a>! I know there are more hurdles for her to go through - like coming up with a first draft screenplay by the 6th of August!!!! But exciting all the same! Congratulations to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2047989/">Nathalie</a>, Gaëlle and <a href="http://www.torinofilmlab.it/person.php?id=678">Jakob</a>.</p>
