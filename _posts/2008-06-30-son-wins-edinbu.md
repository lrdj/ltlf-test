<p>Son won best UK short film at <a href="http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/news/view/2155/eiff-awards-ceremony-29th-june-2008/492/?from=all/1">Edinburgh</a> at the weekend which is very exciting. Laura and I went up last week and spent a few days there which was really good. We met quite a few people there including some of the other filmmakers and had a really great time with them all. Daniel came up at the weekend to pick up the award from Sir Sean Connery, it was a shame to miss that, but here are some pictures of the event.</p>
