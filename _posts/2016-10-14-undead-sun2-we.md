<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_and_Louise_Wilson">Jane and Louise Wilson</a> <a href="http://www.visitmima.com/whats-on/single/jane-and-louise-wilson-undead-sun-we-put-the-world-before-you/">exhibition</a> at <a href="http://www.visitmima.com/">mima</a> (Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art) started at the beginning of the month. It's a fabulous exhibition including the premiere of Jane and Louise's new film which we shot at the <span class="caps">RCA</span> Moving Image Studio over the summer as well as the wind tunnel film we shot at Farnborough as part of the <span class="caps">WWI </span>centennary for the <a href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/">iwm</a>, and exploring related themes. <a href="http://www.martintestar.com/">Martin Testar</a> lit both films with many of the same key team, and commissioned through <a href="http://www.fvu.co.uk/projects/undead-sun-we-put-the-world-before-you"><span class="caps">FVU</span></a>. It was fascinating collaborating with <a href="https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/news/royal-photographic-society-award-for-professor-wilkinson">Professor Caroline Wilkinson</a> from Liverpool John Moores University, who is the amazing expert behind the 3D <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-21328380">facial reconstruction of Richard <span class="caps">III</span></a>.</p>

<p>It's well worth a visit and on until mid January 2017 before moving on to <a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/visit/wolves/">Wolverhampton art gallery</a>.</p>
