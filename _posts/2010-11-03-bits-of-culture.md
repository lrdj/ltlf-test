<p>Since we got back this summer, we seem to have filled the autumn with fun cultural events. Here's a lovely picture of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohna/5100448194/">Apoa and Kiloh</a> at the Almeida where we saw <a href="http://www.almeida.co.uk/production_details/production_details.aspx?code=97">House Of Games</a> &amp; prior to that Ruth Wilson in Through A Glass Darkly which reminds me we also saw a great production of Ruined (although that was before the summer). We also went to see a fantasic expo called Hell's Acre at the Old Vic Tunnels (what an amazing place - it reminded me of Shunt). Here are a couple of pics.<br />

<p>Then of course The London Film Festival's been on and this year I was able to get to see actually quite a lot of films &amp; talks! I think my favourite film was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM0A_yg8XjU">Blue Valentine</a> - I say favourite - but it sure did make me cry! Here's a list anyway of what I saw (if I can remember them all): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXiRZhDEo8A">Never Let Me Go</a> (which I thought was ok, pretty good but lacking in light &amp; shade maybe), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViXR_q3VOFk">Le Quattro Volte</a> (charming &amp; gentle, maybe a bit long), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reRRAEVHq8E">Let Me In</a> (was good, better than I expected, but what did it add to Let The Right One in? Fake snow?...), Self Made (Gillian Waring's film &amp; really interesting, a filmed version of her art work looking into people), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrPtr0aQx3s">Conviction</a> (was good, but a bit classic), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChQB0vpCQWw">The American</a> (Beautiful, but boring neither thriller nor introspective - reminded me a lot of Jim Jarmusch's Limits Of Control but without the amazing De Bankolé etc..), <a href="http://teaser-trailer.com/2010/08/everything-must-go-movie.html">Everything Must Go</a> from Raymond Carver's short story (was also good - Rebecca Hall is in everything indeed &amp; Will Ferrell was really good in this part / Director's first film as well so pretty impressive), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck96h97y9Vs">Miral</a> (was really good), two versions of peace &amp; mending through education (also in First Grader), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzI4D6dyp_o">The King's Speech</a> (was really good, beautiful &amp; subtle &amp; great performances - not usually my kind of film &amp; I'm no big fan of Colin Firth's but he was really great here / My dad will love this film!), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7NmIkrsSkw">West Is West</a> (a good follow up to E is E &amp; entertaining), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gCPIof4kNQ">Les Amours Imaginaires</a> (this film stayed with me in many ways, this guy is such an intresting filmmaker &amp; soooo young. probably a little control freakery as he seems to write, direct, edit, costume etc etc... reminds me Goddard a bit the way Alexis Dos Santos does - stylish but free thinking. Is this true auteur filmmaking?), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5Xy88QUp4I">Abel</a> (Again a really interesting little film, really liked it - not perfect, but the only film I saw that really made me laugh at lots of points with really clever &amp; well executed moments, really interesting premise), <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/amex/video/joanna-hogg">Archipelago</a> (one of those words I can never pronounce properly!) (I hope this director does well, the film had lots of interesting things about it. Although the main thing I keep thinking about are some of her creative choices, like many scenes shot on long lenses but with sound as if very close, but good 2nd film), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jaI1XOB-bs">Black Swan</a> &amp; a talk by Darren Aronovsky (I thought he was great, so down to earth &amp; genuine. I didn't expect that. The film is amazing although not my favourite), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgwjTy_cohg">The Kids Are All Right</a> (I really enjoyed this - how could you not?! - The cast were all so good &amp; likeable/ not art, but good entertainment), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-eBT7vnTLE">The First Grader</a> (Another really enjoyable film, beautiful &amp; sad but with a positive message), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXQsSStHI5c">Submarino</a> (Oh my God this film jammed &amp; melted in the screening &amp; took the Odeon 20 minutes to fix - Thomas Vinterberg was not impressed! But otherwise another really good - if harrowing - film), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yypx-Tz8NzU">Another Year</a> + talk with Mike Leigh (good film, majorly fantastic performance by Leslie Manville, but Mike Leigh came across as a bit of a pompous ungrateful grump - was this just a bad day or is he always that way?), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdWz1IFEv4k">Biutiful</a> (Good film &amp; Javier Bardem is amazing, very similar theme to Submarino... disfunctional familes &amp; how to survive them. but where Thomas Vintenberg is all about subdued naturalism, Iñarittu is about stylising &amp; going over the top), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3cPbxCBGVo">Somewhere</a> (surprised, but I think a bit disapointed. Seemed empty &amp; void of anything much other than it was stylish, langourous, music great in all of Sofia's films, but what else?), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oNtMmnVCbI">I Malavoglia</a> (An Italian film shot in southern Sicily, where poverty makes life very hard for sustaining families. A  modern version of both the famous <span class="caps">XIX </span>novel &amp; Visconti's 1940s film La Terra Trema - good but bleak), and finally <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlhLOWTnVoQ">127 hours</a> (This film was really good. I wasn't sure I wanted to see the film &amp; sit through the grizzlyness &amp; the boredom of a man stuck under a rock for 127 hours, but i should have known better, not a dull moment). </p>

<p>That's an amazing 20 films!! Just think of all the nights in I can now have instead of going to the cinema.... </p>

<p>I had a few gripes with the festival (or the Odeon). There were several really bad projection mistakes and I don't think they were handled very well. In particular the breakage on Submarino &amp; a major recurring out of focus issue in Everything Must Go. Both times the directors were subjected to the torture of seeing their films mangled for large audiences. Really not a nice thing. Also, at pretty much every screening , crowds were let in only when the films started, which meant people would crowd the narrow corridor for up to 10 minutes into the film &amp; you missed the beginnings. Particularly crap when you can't read the subtitles of a language you don't understand! There was a policy to hold industry back from press screenings until the very last minute, I understand press need priority, but this obviously didn't apply to the public screenings and in general just needs a better solution.</p>
