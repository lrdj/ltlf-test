<p>Very cool to be in Cannes again this year with Gaëlle and Nathalie with some excellent meetings for La Fille de l'Estuaire. Lovely hanging out with Robbie Ryan and friends and getting a chance to see excellent world premiere films. My favourite was Ruben Östlund's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/19/the-square-review-ruben-ostlund-elisabeth-moss-cannes-2017">The Square</a>. But I was most moved going to see <a href="http://cineuropa.org/it.aspx?t=interview&amp;l=fr&amp;did=328959">Kaouther Ben Hania</a>'s La Belle et la Meute - which had a <a href="http://www.huffpostmaghreb.com/2017/05/20/cannes-un-standing-ovatio_n_16725446.html">standing ovation</a> at the end.</p>

<p>I had a great surprise when <a href="https://www.kylasimonebruce.com/the-cockatoo-inn">Kyla</a> announced she was shortlisted for the <a href="https://shorts.tv/events/the-pitch">ShortsTV Pitch competition</a> in Cannes. I told her I couldn't think of anything I'd enjoy less than standing in front of people in the UK Tent pitching. But bless her she went ahead and applied all the same and she was shortlisted to go. With a week ahead of the pitch she called to ask if she'd be able to get flights, a badge, somewhere to stay... So of course she did and she was great and before you knew it - she only went and <span class="caps">WON THE BLOOMIN </span>pitching!! So we have a €5,000 prize towards making Mercury.</p>

<p>Very exciting!</p>

<p>Back from Cannes now. Really great week on the Croisette. Awful news from Manchester while we were away. My heart goes out to them. We were reminded every day of the dangers with the Cannes Film Festival security guards ramping up security. They saved the day by taking Zorana and my tweezers away - lethal weapons that those are. We did find an amazing security guard who helped sneak Kyla's beer into the Palais and thus helped her win the competition. He was so lovely - one of a kind. I had to grab his picture.</p>
