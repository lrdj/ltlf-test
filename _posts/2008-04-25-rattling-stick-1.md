<p>I realise it has been over a year since I last updated this site - oops. On the Rattling Stick front, Tom Vaughan went off in June to shoot his second feature film <a href="http://www.rattlingstick.com/news7.html">What Happens In Vegas</a>... with Cameron Diaz &amp; Ashton Kutcher and in fact they had their UK premiere the same night as The Pond so unfortunately I missed it. Johnnie, Chris and Lucy went from Rattling Stick though and really enjoyed it. The US premiere follows shortly this month and then Tom will be available for commercials again. In the meantime I produced a new form of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmEeu0OWD7M">advertsing campaign</a> with Darren Bailes at Mother for <span class="caps">PG.</span> We produced a 10 minute infomercial to feature on free <span class="caps">DVD</span>s (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niPEx5KacG4&amp;feature=related">outtakes</a> &amp; all) that will be available on packs of PG Tips in supermarkets, a 5 minute cinema version to go out before the main attraction in UK cinemas, and 30 &amp; 40 sec trailers for use on internet. Mother and Rattling Stick teamed up as one to make production as cost effective as possible and the result is really good. At the end of 2007 <a href="http://www.rattlingstick.com/steve.html">Steve Cope</a> joined Rattling Stick from Red Bee and I have been producing for him. His debut Rattling Stick commercial was for <span class="caps">KIA </span>cars through Mustoes and now we're busy pitching...</p>
