<p>This summer we've had two big losses. We lost Billy's mum Bessie, who - at the age of 93 - leaves behind Kathleen, Kim, Billy and Mike, as well as many grand children and great grand children. She's had an extraordinary life spanning war, several complicated marriages, motherhood, various family member's addictions, various family member's successes... She's diligently cared for many; both as nurse and carer, as well as mother, grandmother and great grand mother. She's navigated single motherhood in northern Scottish farmland and built a solid beautiful family up there too. At the age of 45 she went back to college to train as a nurse and at the age of 60 she performed topless on a London stage. She enjoyed celebrity and the intimate company of inspiring artists and dancers, travelling all over the world with Michael. She shared the limelight on stage with him and the urban delights, frenzy and the blur of the backstage and touring life in the 80s and 90s. A couple of days after Bessie passed away, we had news of a more shocking tragedy, her great grand daughter Kirstin was in a coma and a few days later passed away too. Little Kirstin was only 16 and had not yet started living her life to the full. She leaves behind her a shocked and grieving family, who will never get to know all the things she might have got up to with her life. Our hearts go out to Phil, Elma and Kyle who will miss her so terribly, it's hard to process it - and of course all her friends and extended family too. </p>
