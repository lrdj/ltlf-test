<p>I have been in Argentina shooting a Philips <span class="caps">LED </span>commercial with Philippe André at Independent. It feels like we have been travelling around in the back of vans every night for weeks, so this sunny afternoon feels special. Tonight will be our last shoot night in Buenos Aires. I'm really looking forward to coming home and thinking about Easter eggs for a change.</p>

<p>It's a beautiful busy place, but hectic and crazy. I can think of nothing nicer than a whole night's sleep!</p>
