<p>We were delighted to welcome so many to <span class="caps">BAFTA </span>last week for our cast and crew screening of Crocodile. We missed those crucial members who couldn't make it. David Ungaro and Carly Reddin for example!! But we were happy to have Michael Gould, Alecky Blythe and so many of our fabulous crew around us. Gaëlle drew everyone up on stage after the screening.</p>
