<p>It's great seeing <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/films/trailers/baby.html">Baby</a> finally take off, after what seemed like a long period of adjustments and not being able to send the <span class="caps">DVD</span>s out to festivals. Cork festival paved the way and now we have just won another award at the <a href="http://www.swff.ee/en/uncategorized-en/winners-of-sleepwalkers-2010/">Sleepwalker's</a> Student and short film festival in Tallin, Estonia, a jury's special mention. That amazing Canadian film <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcr46J7Rliw">Danse Macabre</a> won. I am keeping fingers crossed for Sunday's <span class="caps">BIFA </span><a href="http://bifa.org.uk/ceremony/2010">ceremony</a>, but quite frankly we're just really happy to have even been nominated and we're really looking forward to the event at Old Billingsgate, it feels like our first Christmas party of the year! They are sponsored by MoÃ«t et Chandon - so one thing's for certain; we'll be drinking champagne whether we win or lose!</p>
