<p>... and in fact all three films I had booked to see on Thursday evening as I was happily deflected by the lovely <a href="http://www.factionnorth.com/">Grant Keir</a> who I discover is now based up in Edinburgh, and who invited me to a boat party instead where Andy Jones and Ashley Horner were celebrating the opening of their new Newcastle based production company called <a href="http://www.radiofilm.co.uk/">Radio Film</a>, Outsider Art and Maverick International Documentary. There I met <a href="http://livingwithoutmoney.org/about-the-film/the-filmmakers/line-halvorsen2/">Line Halvorsen</a>, a fascinating Norwegian impact producer who, seven years ago, decided to declutter quite radically and get rid of all her belongings and since lives all over the world, house-sitting, cat-sitting, with the sum total of what she can fit into one suitcase. Then Alex Boden from <a href="http://pistachio.co.uk/html/about_us.htm">Pistachio Pictures</a> came with a load of beers, and an actor friend (of which there are few at Sheffield Film Festival) who was filming a feature nearby came and we all went out for Vietnamese dinner.  </p>

<p>It was also lovely to find Jip Burgess behind the Box Office desk looking very dapper and suited. <br />

Last seen on his way to Cuba to help out on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UnaNocheFilm">Lucy's</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2184331/">Una Noche</a> or in fact I tell a lie as he also worked on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/films.html">Baby</a> which we shot after. But also we were all briefly reunited with the fabulously talented <a href="http://vimeo.com/ariadnafvm">Ariadna Fatjo-Vilas-Mestre</a>, (also last seen in Cuba whilst editing Una Noche! Small world) and who has more recently been involved in editing all our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGfuRe87Ycw">behind the scenes</a> of <a href="http://howtocarveroastunicorn.blogspot.co.uk/2013/05/bombay-sapphire-imagination-series-room.html">Bombay Sapphire shorts</a> films. She has two films at Sheffield that she has edited, <a href="http://theactofkilling.com/">The Act of Killing</a> and <a href="http://melakubelay.com/project">Melaku Belay</a>. We were just discussing how sad it was we hadn't seen the film yet (Una Noche that is), but I have just found out it will be on at <a href="http://www.barbican.org.uk/film/event-detail.asp?ID=15004">The Barbican</a> 3rd July as part of the <a href="http://www.eastendfilmfestival.com/programme/4978/una-noche">East End Film Festival</a>! Can't wait to see it.</p>

<p>I was sad to miss <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2013/jun/13/pussy-riot-documentary-persecuted-orthodox-video">The Pussy Riot</a> film (which was completely sold out) and many more...  But hope to catch many of them in the cinemas or other festivals over the rest of the year.</p>
