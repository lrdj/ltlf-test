<p>I've been keeping busy this past couple of weeks firsting pop promos with <span class="caps">HSI </span>director <a href="http://www.hsilondon.co.uk/Director.aspx?id=114">Douglas Hart</a>. <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Douglas Hart" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/DHarteyes225.jpg" width="225" height="169" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span></p>

<p>Apoa and Kiloh think this is way more impressive than making washing powder ads or short films about suicidal teenagers (actually on second thoughts they might think that was pretty cool too...). </p>

<p>The first promo was an 8 minute track called <a href="http://www.hsilondon.co.uk/clip.aspx?id=837">Sea Within A Sea</a> for The Horrors which was basically all live performance but with a psychadelic projection that made the whole piece look pretty cool. </p>

<p>The second was for <a href="http://www.hsilondon.co.uk/clip.aspx?id=829">Last Of The English Roses</a> by Pete Doherty and involved shooting Pete and a five a side football game outside. I'm sure the temperature had fallen below zero that day and in fact might have contributed to the playback breaking down almost as soon as we started using it!</p>

<p>Heather, our production manager, resorted to chasing the camera &amp; Pete as we paced the football court, with the track playing off her laptop! <span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Heather on playback" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/Heather225.jpg" width="225" height="300" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span> Well it worked thankfully! But we were all relieved when we had to move inside to shoot the final lip-synch inside and standing still!</p>

<p>Kiloh was desperate to miss school and help out on set to be near Pete...</p>
