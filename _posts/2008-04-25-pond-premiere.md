<p>We had The Pond premiere screening at <span class="caps">BAFTA </span>this week and it was a great success. The print looked fabulous up on the big screen, we had a great turnout and the film went down like a storm! It was amazing seeing all the kids who were in the film, unrecognisably grown up after two and a half years. The British Council have picked the film up and we are starting to enter it into festivals in earnest now. Unfortunately I didn't get any pictures, except for two we grabbed as we were leaving... </p>
