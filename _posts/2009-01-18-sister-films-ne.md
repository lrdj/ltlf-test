<p>Just before Daniel heads off to Cuba to start shooting Una Noche, and I head over to Rotterdam to participate in the Producer's Lab - we have finally managed to get the new <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk">Sister Films</a> website up and running! Exciting. It still works better when viewed from a mac than a pc, but we're working on that.</p>

<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Film still of Elio doing a backflip" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/Eliobackflip.jpg" width="700" height="467" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span></p>

<p>We'll try to keep updating the site with anything new and exciting we're up to.</p>

<p>We went to see Slumdog Millionaire yesterday and really enjoyed it. I wonder how they found those kids. What a great cast they put together. I am wondering if Paul Ritchie (the co-producer) is the same Paul Ritchie whose mother is Alison costume designer. If so, I am really really impressed and pleased for him. A great film to pull off so skillfully.</p>
