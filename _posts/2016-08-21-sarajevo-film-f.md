<p>It's been a busy summer producing Jane and Louise Wilson's Undead Sun2 and finalising the French version of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/films-in-development.html">the Girl from the Estuary</a> script. Great news from the Brittany Fund, so our financing is progressing really well but not much time for holidays! So how fabulous to get the opportunity for a little trip to the Balkans.</p>

<p>Because it's been so hard to get writer <a href="http://www.zagrebfilmfestival.com/en/industrija/my-first-script-0">Gorana Jovanovic</a> into the UK to work with director <a href="https://vimeo.com/gameoverfilm">Kyla</a> on the <a href="http://www.kylasimonebruce.com/#!the-cockatoo-inn/d96ys">Cockatoo Inn</a> script together, it seemed opportune to use the <a href="http://www.sff.ba/en">Sarajevo Film Festival</a> as a backdrop for us getting together to update the script for the feature and the short on that project - particularly now that we have heard back that we are still in the running for some great opportunities.</p>

<p>Gorana proved to be an invaluable guide and it was wonderful hearing detailed hitorical facts while visiting the city, the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g294450-d3405261-r143913750-Cajdzinica_Dzirlo_Tea_House-Sarajevo_Sarajevo_Canton.html">tea houses</a> - where we had to take refuge from a sudden downpour, the mosques and old town as well as all along the river.</p>

<p>It was also great to meet up, catch up &amp; hang out with some of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/865403773505766/">Maia 2015</a> gang, many of whom were there including Danijel Hočevar (who had a project as part of <a href="http://www.sff.ba/en/page/industry">CineLink</a> co-production market), Ljiljana Djuricko (who was there with her husband Nikola Đuričko (who was there as part of <a href="http://www.sff.ba/en/news/10517/22nd-sarajevo-film-festival-awards">the jury</a>), Dejan Krajcevski, Sergei Serpuhov and David Lusicic (who was there with a film <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10208981968060452&amp;set=pcb.1108103745902433&amp;type=3&amp;theater">Transmania</a> ). Also Juraj Krasnohorsky with his wife Danka Krasnohorska, and Luka Venturin and Jure Pavlovic (also Maia) and who made fab short <a href="https://www.facebook.com/picnicshortmovie/">Picnic</a> - also with a feature project in Cinelink. </p>

<p>It was also great getting to meet <span class="caps">GL'</span>s Lizzie's boyfriend Tom who writes for Screendailies, and to see <a href="http://film.britishcouncil.org/comment/spotlight/2015/fyzal-boulifa">Fyzal Boulifa</a> out there - even though we failed to really catch up (which is a shame as he's living in Paris now), and the king of the dance floor <a href="http://www.neweuropefilmsales.com/-">Jan Naszewski</a> who was also jury member at the festival. And briefly Antoine Le Bos, Stefano Tealdi, and Sanja Ravlić (from Croatian Film fund).</p>

<p>And last but absolutely not least - I saw two films while I was there and so pleased I did. First surprise was to see Mike Goodridge of Protagonist presenting a film called <a href="http://www.thefitsfilm.com/">The Fits</a> by <a href="http://filmmakermagazine.com/people/anna-rose-holmer/#.V7nlSrWqEfo">Anna Rose Holmer</a>. This film was about an 11 year old girl drawn to dancing and fitting in - so no mystery why I chose that screening. So glad I saw it, it was a super interesting, beautifully atmospheric film!! Also made through the <a href="http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/collegecinema/">Venice Biennale College Cinema</a>, so great to see what's possible within the constraints imposed by tight budget and schedule. </p>

<p>And of course I had to see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/godless.bezbog/?fref=ts">Godless</a>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/ralitzapetrova">Ralitza Petrova</a>'s film. Having heard so much about the film, from its beginnings at <a href="http://www.legroupeouest.com/">Le Groupe Ouest</a> alongside Gaëlle as these projects were born, to our initial French producer visits in Paris and hearing all the difficult stories that occurred in the middle of shooting - I was not disapointed. Ralitza is super talented and the film is so strong (albeit not joyful!!). I am so glad it is beginning its festival life with a bang. Premiered in <a href="http://www.pardolive.ch/pardo/festival-del-film-locarno/home.html;jsessionid=C2BD6125615720651DE86628FF064751">Locarno</a> it won both the <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/godless-locarno-film-festival-winners-1201837166/">Golden Leopard</a> &amp; prize for best actress. And here at Sarajevo it won <span class="caps">SPECIAL JURY PRIZE </span>and <span class="caps">HEART</span> OF <span class="caps">SARAJEVO FOR BEST ACTRESS </span>for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KarabashevaIren?fref=ts">Irena Ivanova</a> who was amazing. She reminded me of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.leninimports.com%2Frenee_maria_falconetti_11a_j.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.leninimports.com%2Frenee_maria_falconetti_11a.html&amp;h=1016&amp;w=1392&amp;tbnid=YmSEwukQRpVIIM%3A&amp;tbnh=146&amp;tbnw=200&amp;docid=TYK7okCOp-8QQM&amp;itg=1&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;usg=__DPfTe3Nr0WyKegB_uj6DZ_T-PG0=%23h=1016&amp;tbnh=146&amp;tbnw=200&amp;w=1392as">Renée Jeanne Falconetti</a> Joan of Arc in Carl Dreyer's film. I expected Godless to be dark and bleak, but I was gripped, moved and captivated right the way through to the end. Congratulations to Ralitza, her producer <a href="http://www.torinofilmlab.it/people/743-rossitsa-valkanova">Rossitsa Valkanova</a> of <a href="http://www.klasfilm.com/index.html"><span class="caps">KLAS</span> Films</a> and the team. It goes to show with strength and resilience and a whole lot of talent you can do wonders. </p>
