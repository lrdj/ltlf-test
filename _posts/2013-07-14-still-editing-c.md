<p>After a nice little break, next week <a href="http://trimediting.blogspot.co.uk/">Paul</a> will be back from New York for a couple of days, so we'll be back in the edit suite. It feels like the edits on short films are particularly intense. We have spent day and night at Trim for weeks. So far we've celebrated both our birthdays there, shared breakfasts, lunches and dinners, childcare, meetings and lots and lots of homework. It has in fact become our home from home.</p>

<p>Now we have our <span class="caps">BFI </span>notes and we're set to go back in. </p>
