<p><span class="caps">THE JOY</span> OF <span class="caps">SIX </span>is now available for pre-order on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Joy-Six-DVD-Judi-Dench/dp/B00AAXZ5VQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357731828&amp;sr=1-1">Amazon.co.uk</a>.  This is a great platform to not only sell the title but also to promote through views and reviews.</p>

<p>It would be great if the filmmaking population rally behind what is quite a niche but important release and encourage more distribution of short films as Soda Pics have done with <span class="caps">THE JOY</span> OF <span class="caps">SIX.</span></p>

<p>I would greatly appreciate it you could please forward this on to friends, family and in particular your own filmmaking connections to help stir a conversation in this essential audience to support the release with reviews and buys.  </p>

<p>Reviews of the compilation and the individual films can be read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B00AAXZ5VQ/ref=dp_db_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">here</a>. It would be great to have more contributors as the <span class="caps">DVD </span>campaign gets underway.</p>
