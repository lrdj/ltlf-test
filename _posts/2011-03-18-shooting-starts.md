<p>We start shooting Long Distance Information on Tuesday next week. All our cast are now in place and they are all brilliant! We've confirmed all our locations and key crew, now we're working on the rest of the crew, equipment, props...<br />
We set up a page (although still <span class="caps">WIP</span>) on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ohnafalby#!/pages/Long-Distance-Information/173346549380509">facebook</a> and a fundraising site to Doug raise more money to finish the film and repay the debt. If anyone reads this and wants to help, please forward the link to the <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/Long-Distance-Information">indiegogo page</a> on.<br />
