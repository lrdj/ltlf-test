<p>Daniel, Arta, Laura and I went to <span class="caps">EIFF </span>together. It was great meeting some of the filmmakers (Antonio Piazza - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes.php?id=299518111435&amp;notes_tab=app_2347471856"><span class="caps">RITA</span></a> best international short) &amp; catching up with a few of the filmmakers from the cinema extreme workshops, a few who had films in competition too. Fyzal Boulifa, Scott Graham &amp; David Smith, Rosie Crerar &amp; Ruth Paxton was there with <a href="http://de-de.facebook.com/pages/PARISSEXY/113761225333314?v=info"><span class="caps">PARIS</span>/SEXY,</a> Olivier was there with <span class="caps">THOMAS.</span> It was also good seeing Ross Neil there with <a href="http:////www.defoefilm.com/"><span class="caps">DEFOE</span></a> (which won a jury's mention!). </p>

<p>We had a fantastic screening as part of the cinema extreme shorts, then Tony Grisoni &amp; Mike Elliott organised drinks and Jo from Film4 took us all out to dinner to celebrate afterwards. </p>

<p>Last night there was a shorts awards ceremony. It was a feeling of great achievement finally whisking the 1st 35mm print out of Technicolor and jumping on a train, and getting into Edinburgh just in time for the screening! It was an even greater sense of achievement to be awarded best uk short award at the end of the festival. A big thank you to all at the UK Film Council and Film4 as well as everyone who helped us make this stunning film.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4740378696_dc6a02c821.jpg">happy result</a>  meant carrying a magnum of Moet home on the train this afternoon! Exciting.</p>
