This year my highlight of the festival was going to NFT1 to listen to an interview with [CÃ©line Sciamma](https://www.instagram.com/celine_sciamma/?hl=en), fabulously talented French writer director of Water Lilies, Tomboy, Girlhood (writer of the animated My Life as a Courgette) and in this year's festival - her period piece [Portrait of a Lady on Fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE_lGeDtDO0).

I also loved [MONOS](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/13/monos-review-alejandro-landes) a film by Colombian filmmaker Alejandro Landes (with mainly street-cast kids and with that guy from Kings of Summer and actress Julianne Nicholson who will blow everyone away!), Alexis de Santos is also credited for helping with the writing and the fabulously talented [Mica Levi](https://www.beggarsmusic.com/artist_page/mica-levi/) for the score. This film was interesting on so many different levels. Not a subject matter I would usually flock to see, but I was completely taken in once I saw where it was going. You couldn't help but think how intense the making of this film must have been too. The other extraordinary film I saw was called [BEANPOLE](https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=beanpole) by Russian filmmaker Kantemir Balagov (which is on [Mubi](https://mubi.com/films/beanpole) just now - so catch it there if you can!!). It was like a work of art come to life. Again two amazing actresses - both (I think) also complete newcomers.
