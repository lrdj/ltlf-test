<p>After a very successful week in Rotterdam, Gaëlle and I presented La Fille De <span class="caps">L'E</span>stuaire to over 45 professionals (co-producers, distributors, sales agents and film fund representatives) in half hour back to back meetings. We were blown away by the range of people we saw and were able to connect with. The <span class="caps">IFFR </span>is an incredibly friendly festival all centred in one large building and surrounding area, which makes it very easy to meet and socialise as well as view films and attend talks and workshops. The <a href="https://www.iffr.com/professionals/cinemine/cinemart-profile/">Cinemart team</a> were obviously well accustomed to dealing with the complicated process of facilitating all these meetings and they looked after everyone efficiently and always with a smile on their faces. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY-hIgGC7Sg">Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy</a> won the <a href="https://www.iffr.com/professionals/news-2014-2015/cinemart-announces-winners/">Arte award</a> for his project <a href="http://www.alphaviolet.com/cinemart-sundance-awards-for-luxembourg/">Luxembourg</a>. His producer <a href="http://eave.org/network/19942/">Anna Katchko</a> soldiered through all the meetings while Myroslav flew off to Sundance where he was simultaneously awarded <a href="http://www.sundance.org/blogs/news/sundance-institute-selects-global-filmmaking-awards-presented-by-aj-at-the-2015-sundance-film-festival">the 2015 Sundance Institute Global Filmmaking Award</a> for the project. So $10,000 from Sundance &amp; €7,000 from cinemart. He's off to a good start!! Director <a href="http://vimeo.com/nathalieteirlinck">Nathalie Teirlinck</a> and her producers from <a href="http://www.savagefilm.be/home/">Savage Films</a> in Belgium won the coveted Eurimages award of €20,000 for their project Tonic Immobility and the Cuban team Director <a href="https://www.festivalscope.com/director/lechuga-carlos">Carlos Lechuga</a> and his Producer: <a href="http://eave.org/network/calvino/">Claudia Calviño</a> won the Wouter Barendrecht Award of €5,000. </p>

<p>We were excited to come back to London to start our next stage of script development with <a href="http://www.torinofilmlab.it/person.php?id=1">Franz Rodenkirchen</a> and Creative England. </p>
