<p>Last September we thought we'd try out that new local restaurant, Dabbous. We didn't book as it was still pretty new and we hadn't been that organised. The friendly person who greeted us shrugged and smiled explaining that people have to book months in advance in order to get a table. So we thought "ok", let's put our names down for a table 10 months away and calculated that we could book a table for 4 for Rebecca's birthday on the 11th July. It seemed mad, but actually, that 10 months came round really quickly and there we were, last night, celebrating Rebecca's birthday with champagne cocktails at the bar downstairs knowing we a table safely booked and waiting for us upstairs. We went for the epic Dabbous taster menu and also opted to follow suit with the wines. The sommelier chose a different half glass of wine for us with every dish. What followed was quite amazing and spectacular. First up was the minty peas. A work of art which maybe remained my favourite! I can't remember what all the wines were. I know we started with a Picpoul du Pinet, but I'm a bit foggy after that and noticed by the time the cheese and dessert came, the glasses were stockpiling a bit and I'm not sure I was drinking the right wine with the right dish. Oops. We ended with a cream custard pie (or tart I can't remember what he called it) and that was really amazing too.</p>

<p>I tried to get a picture of everything but missed a few of the items.</p>

<p>Well we all agreed that it was worth the 10 month wait! We'll probably have to wait another 10 months before we can afford to go out for dinner again so I won't recommend this to anyone on a tight budget!</p>
