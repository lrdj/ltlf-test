<p><span class="mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Krakow IFF logo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/i/image001.jpg" width="150" height="85" class="mt-image-left" style="float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;" /></span> Last night we won a silver dragon award at the <a href="http://www.kff.com.pl/en/news/168">Krakow International Film Festival</a> for <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/films/trailers/baby.html">Baby</a>. We were really excited to get the news as this festival means a lot to us, Daniel having been awarded the <span class="caps">UIP </span>award there in the past for <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/films/trailers/dad.html">Dad</a> and being nominated for a European Academy Award. Thankfully Laura was able to jump on a plane to be there for the ceremony, deliver Daniel's message of thanks and to collect the award (which she was then able to convince security to let her back on the plane with to take home).</p>

<p>So far in total Baby has got into <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/2011/02/baby-festivals.html">37 International Film Festivals</a>, been nominated 12 times and has won <a href="http://www.sisterfilms.co.uk/films/awards.html">8 awards</a>.</p>
