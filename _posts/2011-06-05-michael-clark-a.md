<p>Mike's back at Tate Modern in the Turbine Hall for a short 4 or 5 days as of Wednesday next week - this coming week. We went to see him last night &amp; it was a fantastic unmissable show, so I can only imagine that by Wednesday it will be even more so. He has new David Bowie footage, new costumes from Stevie, new tracks, new moves &amp; apparantly there will also be screening of John Maybury &amp; Ceryth's films - but I'm not sure if that's separate. I'll have to <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/eventseducation/film/24002.htm">read up</a> what it says. It's a really exciting space to see them dance in. Anyone who cares anything about dance &amp; in fact everyone should go see it if you can get a ticket! Book <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/eventseducation/musicperform/22727.htm">here!</a></p>

<p>Mike was looking great, the only trace of his scary lung thing was that his operation scar<br />
was visible beneath his costume... </p>

<p>It was all marvellous and i can't wait to see it again next week!</p>
