We are so thrilled that <a href="https://vimeo.com/271623742">Mercury</a> has been selected to premier at <a href="https://encounters-festival.org.uk/events/short-film-5-right-thing/">Encounters Film</a> Festival, <span class="caps">UK'</span>s Clermont Ferrand! What a great way to start the film's festival trajectory.

With its premiere now announced, and with our DCP finally in hand it was also one of our priorities to organise a cast and crew screening this summer, but I had never imagined we'd manage the wonderful swanky theatre at Soho House.

It was luck would have it, that fellow filmmaker friends <a href="https://paulfrankl.com/">Paul Frankl</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4494696/mediaindex?ref_=nm_mv_close">Maria Tanjala</a> of <a href="https://unblockedevents.com/2018/05/23/film-producers-needs-blockchain-maria-tanjala-filmchain/">Film Chain</a> and <a href="https://www.bigcouch.co.uk/">Big Couch</a> would be organising their cast and crew screening of <a href="https://vimeo.com/276235018">Goldstar</a> this summer too. The films had so much in common: Two powerful accounts with unconventional and thought-provoking takes on young women with unwanted pregnancies.

It was a great turnout - although two big absences due to availability! <a href="https://twitter.com/izzylaughland?lang=en">Isabella</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ashtonlilz?lang=en-gb">Lily</a>!
