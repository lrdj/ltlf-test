<p>My first time at <a href="http://sheffdocfest.com/"><span class="caps">SIFF</span></a> and so far it's been great - except for today's tropical downpour. </p>

<p>It was quieter on Tuesday for the Crossover Market but now that the <a href="http://sheffdocfest.com/view/meetmarket">Meet Market</a> has kicked in in earnest, Sheffield is full of people strolling around with pink lanyards. The festival opened with a fantastic screening of <a href="http://sheffdocfest.com/films/show/5537">The Big Melt</a> which is a documentary made up of <span class="caps">BFI </span>archive material: a documentary by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1071913/">Martin Wallace</a>, it splices archive footage of the city and its steelworkers to a live soundtrack by Jarvis Cocker and other Sheffield musical alumni, including the City of Sheffield Brass Band, Richard Hawley and members of his band, some of Cocker's Pulp colleagues, the Forgemasters, a string quartet and a youth choir.</p>

<p>But meanwhile it's all about meetings and pitches... But later tonight I might get to see Werner Herzog eating his shoe.</p>
