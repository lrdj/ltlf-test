Me &amp; Mine</a> was finally finished too - previously known as Credible Passion (see entry back in August when we shot in Bournemouth &amp; Bourneville). </p>

<p><a href="http://www.lucybeech.com/">Lucy Beech</a>'s new work 'Me and Mine' is a 40-minute film pivoting around an annual awards event called the <a href="http://goodfuneralawards.co.uk/">The Good Funeral Awards</a> at which the growing contribution of women to the funeral industry is celebrated (awards given out for best grave digger etc...), 'Me and Mine' records (and applauds) this transformation, but also pauses to reflect on what else these changes might be said to signify. It premiered at the <a href="http://www.harrismuseum.org.uk/">Harris Museum and Art Gallery</a>, Preston, from 2 May - 4 July, before travelling to <a href="http://thetetley.org/">Tetley,</a> Leeds, from 17 July - 27 September. This is her most significant solo show to date. </p>

<p>Lucy's work often (maybe even always?) includes an element of choreography / body theatre. She takes every day (sometimes mundane) situations and analyses them &amp; replays them in a way that makes them extraordinary, making the audience think about things in a very different way. Working with <a href="http://www.claravangool.nl/">Clara van Gool</a> on The Beast in the Jungle and Voices of Finance, has made me think of Lucy and her work again. There is something so intriging working with dancers in these contexts. </p>

<p>I really love Lucy's film <a href="https://vimeo.com/59295624">Open House</a>, <a href="http://www.robertcrosse.com">Rob</a> taking prospective buyers through the rituals of home showing. Great piece.</p>
