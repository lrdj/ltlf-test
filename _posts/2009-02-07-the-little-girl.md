I have been trying to get a hold of it for ages &amp; keep bugging people about it - now Billy has ordered it from Lovefilm and it is here!!! It'll probably feel very 70's, but let's hope it's as good as I remembered it to be...</p>

<p>I think it's the first film I ever saw Jodie Foster and Martin Sheen in (although I must have seen Bugsy Malone). They were both amazingly well cast in these roles. The film was so skillfully directed and the performances were so strong that for a long time my brother and I were obsessed with this film. The image of Jodie's stony tight-lipped face as Martin Sheen stroked her fair fair hair... and I will always remember to use an almond flavoured tea if I ever plan to poison anyone with arsenic. </p>

<p>Jodie Foster was already by then an incredibly accomplished actress bearing in mind she was only 12 or 13 when she made this film (I think anyway!). She seemed to have cornered the market for 'older than her years' most notably with her roles as Tallulah &amp; the teenager in Taxi Driver. In fact one of the most exciting star-spotting moments in my life was sitting at a table next to her at a restaurant on l'ile de la cit√© in Paris. I believe we were celebrating my friend's 16th birthday and we were probably a little loud and giggly. When we asked the waiter if the girl sitting at the table there was indeed Jodie Foster, he embarassed us all by saying "Jodie quoi???" very loudly and repeatedly. </p>

<p>She was so cool she just smiled at us.</p>
