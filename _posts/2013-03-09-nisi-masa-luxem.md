<p>Last weekend I participated once again in the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nisimasa?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts">Nisi Masa</a> European Short Pitch with 25 teams pitching their <a href="http://issuu.com/emiliep/docs/esp_bookofprojects">short film projects</a> to <a href="http://nisileaks.wordpress.com/2013/03/06/european-short-pitch-2013-book-of-producers/">35 producers</a> and funders from around Europe. As always the event was a great success and I was impressed with the caliber of projects and talent put before us. The  <a href="http://nisileaks.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/european-short-pitch-2013-awards/">three winners</a> were: From Liverpool, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/filmnetwork/users/35757840">Mike Forshaw</a> with a short drama called Saturday, set around the Hillsborough disaster of 1989, From Lithuania <a href="http://vimeo.com/kaupinis">Karolis Kaupinis</a> with a surreal sounding short called The Noise Maker, set in a school that doesn't have enough pupils (it was like watching Ian Curtis delivering a film pitch, it was extraordinary and he kept the audience in stitches with his incredibly deadpan delivery), and From Romania (but based in London) <a href="http://www.adinaistrate.com/">Adina Istrate</a> called The Gender Reassignment Musical, which pretty much tells you what it its about. I must say all three of these pitches were absolutely excellent and I think all three stories stand a really good chance of being made into really great short films.</p>

<p>There were many other projects and pitches that were memorable, some were a little crazy and surprising, and others were more sober. A London-based writer-actor (from Iran &amp; Stockholm) called <a href="http://directors.youngvic.org/index.php?pid=25&amp;page=Y&amp;amp">Yashar Alishenas</a>; gave an entertaining Woody Allen-esque performance, another London-based actor-director called <a href="http://www.jamesschlesinger.co.uk/">James Schlesinger</a> held an impeccably timed exchange with the lovely <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0263740/?ref_=tt_ov_st">Steve Evets</a> who he brought over with him on his pitch teaser.  Another team from Lithuania with a project called The Queen Of England Stole My Parents have already set out a successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/867420487/the-queen-of-england-stole-my-parents-0?play=1&amp;ref=search">Kickstarter campaign</a>, which was so catchy they attracted a rich Sheik's thousands within the first day of their project going live. Another team presented their entire pitch dressed as cat and dog, whilst a team from Russian spent half their pitch shouting manically at each other and the audience. </p>

<p>Over the weekend I had the chance to meet really interesting women directors and their producers, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4214454/">Jenni Toivoniemi</a> from Finland and <a href="http://cnoakley.tumblr.com/">Claire Oakley</a> from the <span class="caps">UK, </span>whose previous shorts are truly breathtaking. In fact Jenni's latest short <a href="http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13185/the_date">The Date</a>, just won <a href="http://www.sundance.org/festival/release/2013-sundance-film-festival-announces-jury-awards-in-short-filmmaking/">best international short</a> at Sundance. Another project by a woman filmmaker was called Ana and is a genuine personal story which promises to become an award-winning short (if it's made...). It is written and to be directed by London-based Spanish director <a href="http://www.carlasimonpipo.com/?cat=1">Carla Pipo</a>. </p>
