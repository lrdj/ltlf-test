<p>What a wonderful surprise to find Osama here at Rotterdam! Osama was selected for the CineMart but was not able to attach a producer to the project in time. So he has brought his project here after all with posters, pamphlets and a short promo film he put together which really brings the project to life. After coming in to the cinemart drinks session, he had a crowd of interested producers around him. It won't be long now before they are fighting over the project! Maybe even Patrick Cassavetti...</p>
