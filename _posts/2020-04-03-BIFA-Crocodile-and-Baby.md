[BIFA](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-cQke7JUpg/) has had a great idea in this period of Coronavirus lockdown - they have made all the BIFA nominated and winner shorts over the past 10 years available to view for FREE. How lovely to see [BABY](https://vimeo.com/259481661) and [CROCODILE](https://vimeo.com/106922930/3b27f70e14) up there and among such an exciting batch of films - great to be able to watch them all.

You can watch all the films on their [LINK](https://www.bifa.film/news/lockdown-watch-bifa-nominated-shorts-here/)
