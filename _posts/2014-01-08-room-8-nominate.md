<p>The exciting news is that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp63Qpp8h4k">Room 8</a> has been nominated for a <span class="caps">BAFTA</span>!! How brilliant is that? This <a href="http://awards.bafta.org/award/2014/film">list of nominees</a> is also really great. I'm so happy <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/news/bfi-shorts-update-part-5">Keeping Up With Jones</a> was nominated - I thought that film was wonderful. I haven't seen <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/bfi-shorts-2012/orbit-ever-after">Orbit Ever After</a>, but I've heard lots about it and there's a lovely making of film you can watch <a href="http://vimeo.com/73152281">here</a>. And <a href="http://www.lighthouse.org.uk/bfi-shorts-2012/sea-view">Sea View</a> is Jane Linfoot's film, so I am excited for her too. I don't know Island Queen, but look forward to seeing it. So congratulations <a href="http://www.sigmafilms.com/films/sea-view-short/">Jane &amp; Anna</a>, <a href="http://incendiarypictures.com/">Megan</a> and <a href="http://michael-pearce.com/">Michael</a>, <a href="http://www.vennerfilm.com/">Sophie</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.jwgriffiths.com/">James</a>!! Woo hoo.</p>
