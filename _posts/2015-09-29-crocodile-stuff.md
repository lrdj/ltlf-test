<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_5xuw-BT7M">Crocodile</a> continued to have a great year and Gaëlle and I did a bit more travelling to places like <a href="http://www.clermont-filmfest.com/?nlang=2">Clermont Ferrand</a>, where we had a great time with <a href="https://twitter.com/LorenzoZe">Laurent Crouzeix</a> and fellow filmmakers, <a href="https://twitter.com/philipilson?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Philip Ilson</a>, Simon Young and Chris, the <a href="http://encounters-festival.org.uk/">Encounters</a> team and the guys from <a href="http://www.nisimasa.com/">Nisi Masa</a>... It's always amazing having a film there - seeing real audiences queue to see the films and listen to them argue and debate about the films afterwards. There was a man in the queue who was so excited to discover the team behind Crocodile and he was able to ask Gaëlle so many questions that were puzzling him. And of course lots more.. Girls on Film in Shoreditch (another one of Philip's <span class="caps">Q&amp;A </span>led screenings), we were in Paris when we got the amazing news Crocodile won best short award at the uber-cool <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cellulartin">Cellu l'art</a> film festival in Germany - what a shame Gaëlle couldn't make it over there! We were thrilled the film got into Minimalen in Norway, Ankara, Hoboken, Palm Springs along with Paul's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Roxannethemovie?fref=ts">Roxanne</a> - again gutted not to be able to go... And we finally got to showcase the film in amongst its brother and sister <span class="caps">BFI </span>shorts at the <span class="caps">ICA.</span></p>
