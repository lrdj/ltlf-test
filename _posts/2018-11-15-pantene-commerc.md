Coming out of summer, a great little job came to us from New York via a FB recommendation from fabulous DoP <a href="http://www.bradrushing.com/">Brad Rushing</a> who I worked with on commercials with <a href="http://www.josephkahn.com">Joseph Kahn</a> back in the day. Amazing how these things can work!

<a href="http://cinemastreet.net/about-us/">Dana Offenbach</a> from CinemaStreet Pictures got in touch and after some pitching and budgeting and all the usual, we got <a href="http://www.shakyradowlingcasting.com/">Shakyra Dowling</a> ( from Mercury) to start searching hard and fast for the cast - she did an amazing job.

We had a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/LTLFilmstars/photos/?ref=page_internal">great time</a> producing the 4 commercials for <a href="http://www.tracybrosnan.com/n">Tracy Brosnan</a> creative director at <a href="http://www.devriesglobal.com/en-gb/node/9">DeVries</a> and a great opportunity to reconnect with <a href="https://www.sonjaphillips.co.uk/WORK-1">Sonja Phillips</a> who I got on board to direct them. We had a fantastic crew: <a href="http://www.susannesalavati.com/">Susanne Salavati</a> on camera, <a href="https://www.prettydata.co.uk/">Ray Moody</a> on 2nd unit,  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4469860/">John Thorpe</a> (from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mercuryshortfilm/?hl=en">Mercury</a>) on sound, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/louiscaseley/">Louis Caseley</a> and <a href="https://www.alicemaemayall.co.uk/">Alice-Mae Mayall</a> on art department, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hollyfpee/?hl=en">Holly Fowles-Pazdro</a> (from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/life2livefilmscrocodile/">Crocodile</a>) on hair and make-up - which was a great opportunity for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kilohfalbyclark/">Kiloh</a> to gain more make-up assisting experience #MUA.
