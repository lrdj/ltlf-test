<p>It's sad when a festival ends, especially when it was set on a sunny beach and you are based in London, and despite being the end of May, the rain keeps falling and the sky is grey. I made a sad farewell to the deserted Miramar and the two lovely ticket guys under the Semaine De La Critique canopy.</p>

<p>The train to journey to Paris left the bobbing jangling boats &amp; bright blue sea and emerged in a downpour.</p>

<p>But it's not all sad... As I sift through the pictures, the business cards and scribbles on torn bits of paper, a smile returns to my face even as I reach for a second fleecy jumper. </p>

<p>For one, this was the first time I submitted a film to Cannes and the first time I had a film selected at Cannes and the first time I won a prize at Cannes! So worth reliving that moment briefly here. One of the wonderful things about the <a href="http://www.semainedelacritique.com/EN/selection.php">Semaine de La Critique</a> is that they are very down to earth. We got used to turning up for everything in jeans and flip flops if it suited us, so on the final evening when they were going to announce the winners, Gaëlle and I had a moment's clothing crisis - do we dress up, don't we? Nathalie convinced Gaëlle it was a good idea to wear something nice, just in case... So she went out and bought a pair of high heeled shoes and put on her favourite top and pleated trousers. When we got to the Miramar most the young filmmakers were standing outside smoking in their black suits and glam outfits - all buzzing with the sense of anticipation in the air. Gaëlle and I suddenly noticed <a href="http://filmmakermagazine.com/people/jonas-carpignano/#.U4SYdhiIWt8">Jonas Carpignano</a> stepping out of a taxi and greeting his dad. "Ah" we thought. If they have flown him back from Italy, then it's a sure sign that he is a winner. Jonas had the 5th short film in our programme, called <a href="http://www.semainedelacritique.com/EN/films/2014/2014_comp_a_ciambra.php">A Ciambra</a>. It is a beautiful short set in Sicily about a streetwise gyspy boy navigating the world of men, smoking like a chimney, back-talking, wise-cracking and even getting his first prostitute blow-job. A sure winner! And well-deserved.</p>

<p>So it came as a bit of a shock as the lady up on stage with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVeemALDpDI">Charles Tesson</a> started to describe the first winner as one of the female directors (after lauding Tesson and his team for nominating 10 short films representing directors of an equal gender balance 50% men and 50% women), "a very precise and extremely talented filmmaker". Then she proceeded to describe the winning film as follows "...her film kept us in a tension of very strange emotions. Her film is a visual feat in the jaws of the animal"... It had to be "CROCODILE". How exciting Gaëlle lept up onto stage to <a href="http://youtu.be/oeQtv4iRyOY">accept the award</a> and was so giddy she could barely stand still.</p>

<p>Afterwards it was a bit of a blurr, but the results of the <a href="http://www.semainedelacritique.com/EN/prixpalmares.php">awards</a> giving was Gaëlle getting the Canal + prize and Jonas Carpignano getting the Sony CineAlta Discovery Prize, <a href="http://www.unifrance.org/annuaires/personne/333410/boris-lojkine">Boris Lojkine</a> received the <span class="caps">SACD </span>prize with his film <a href="http://www.semainedelacritique.com/EN/films/2014/2014_comp_hope.php">Hope</a>, and sweeping the board with his amazing film <a href="http://www.semainedelacritique.com/EN/films/2014/2014_comp_tribe.php">The Tribe</a>, <a href="http://screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/the-tribe/5072421.article">Myroslav Slaboshpitskiy</a> (from troubled Ukraine) recieved the Nespresso Grand Prize as well as the Visionary award and the Gan Foundation award!!</p>

<p>After the awards ceremony Nathalie and I stayed at the Miramar to watch the semaine's closing film <a href="http://www.semainedelacritique.com/EN/films/2014/2014_spe_hippocrate.php">Hipprocates</a> while Gaëlle dashed off to a Cinéfondations dinner. We were not only thrilled to have Ryan Gosling join us to watch the film (well slip into the cinema &amp; sit amongst the audience) but the film was fantastic and I'm so glad to have seen it.</p>

<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/05/Hippocrates-Shots1000-891.html" onclick="window.open('{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/05/Hippocrates-Shots1000-891.html','popup','width=1000,height=309,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/05/Hippocrates-Shots1000-thumb-500x154-891.jpg" width="500" height="154" alt="Hippocrates-Shots1000.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>It is a film about doctors in an under-privileged hospital in Paris, directed by <a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-hippocrates-1201188877/">Thomas Lilti</a> (once himself a doctor) and starring <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Lacoste">Vincent Lacoste</a> as a young intern coming to work in a hospital his father runs. He is set to make his mark and start a long successful career as a doctor, but finds the internship a major challenge. Not only working under his father, but competing with a more experienced and passionate intern (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reda_Kateb">Reda Kateb</a>) who challenges his preconceptions and opens his eyes to the real world.</p>

<p>Gaëlle then came and joined us and the rest of the semaine team and filmmakers and guests at the Nespresso beach Semaine party where we danced beside the jury presided by the dancefloor queen herself Andrea Arnold. </p>

<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/05/Night-Out1000-900.html" onclick="window.open('{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/05/Night-Out1000-900.html','popup','width=1000,height=250,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets_c/2014/05/Night-Out1000-thumb-500x125-900.jpg" width="500" height="125" alt="Night-Out1000.jpg" class="mt-image-none" style="" /></a></p>

<p>They played great music and were distributing free champagne and cocktails all night, but when Julien Lilti from the Hippocrates team invited us to go to David Lynch's Silencio night club - we couldn't pass up the opportunity to check that out. </p>
