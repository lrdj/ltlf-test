We are very excited to announce that <a href="http://www.rachelmaclean.com/">Rachel Maclean</a> and I were awarded a place on the brand spanking new <a href="https://attagirl.online/">ATTAGURL LAB</a> (aka Attagirl) with [MELTED](https://lifetolivefilms.com/share/Melted_EPK.pdf) - a feature project we are developing with the support of [Screen Scotland](https://www.screen.scot/about). This is such a cool scheme and we are thrilled to be one of the 13 pioneer teams and very thankful to the BFI for their financial support. The lab kicked off on Friday night with the first leg running alongside [TIFF](https://www.tiff.net/)

Attagurl has been devised by [ForFilmsSake](https://www.screenwest.com.au/news-events/2020/09/for-films-sake-announces-thirteen-global-projects-for-first-edition-of-attagirl/)'s [Sophie Mathisen](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sophie-mathisen) (one of ‘200 women who will change the world’) and dedicated to creating production and distribution pathways for feature films by female and non-binary creative teams. They have announced there are six Australian projects (one a UK co-pro with writer-producer Samantha Collins, director Laura Scrivano, and fellow producer-colleague Jessie Mangum), one from New Zealand, one from Sweden, two from Canada, ours from the UK, and one US/Nigeria co-pro, and one UK/Mexico/Canada co-pro with writer/directors Nora Unkel and Michele Cervera Garzia, producers Colin Day (also fellow-UK producer!!) and Coco Marie Schneider. More details can be found <a href="https://www.if.com.au/australian-and-international-creative-teams-named-for-inaugural-attagirl-feature-lab/">here.

We are thrilled to be selected alongside such a fantastic group of filmmakers with exceptional projects. The Attagurl team pulled together a super impressive team of experts we will be working with and have generous ambitious plans for us and our projects - can't wait to get crackin'.
